# sandbox_exporter
Package to load, query, and export data from ITS DataHub's sandbox efficiently.
For more information on ITS Sandbox data, please refer to the [ITS Sandbox README page](https://github.com/usdot-its-jpo-data-portal/sandbox/tree/split-repo#exporting-data-to-csv-with-sandbox-exporter).

This repository currently includes several importable utilities for interacting with the ITS Sandbox S3 buckets. These utilities uses Python 3.x as the primary programming language and can be executed across operative systems.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for use, development, and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

1. Have access to [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You can check your python version by entering `python --version` and `python3 --version` in command line.
2. Have access to the command line of a machine. If you're using a Mac, the command line can be accessed via the [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac), which comes with Mac OS. If you're using a PC, the command line can be accessed via the Command Prompt, which comes with Windows, or via [Cygwin64](https://www.cygwin.com/), a suite of open source tools that allow you to run something similar to Linux on Windows.
3. Have your own Free Amazon Web Services account.
	- Create one at http://aws.amazon.com
4.  Obtain Access Keys:
	- On your Amazon account, go to your profile (at the top right)
	- My Security Credentials > Access Keys > Create New Access Key
	- Record the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key ID (you will need them in step 4)
5. Save your AWS credentials in your local machine, using one of the following method:
	- shared credentials file: instructions at https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html#shared-credentials-file.
	- environmental variables: instructions at https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html#environment-variables

### Installation

1. Download the script by cloning the module's [code repository on GitHub](https://github.com/usdot-its-jpo-data-portal/wzdx_sandbox). You can do so by running one of the following in command line. If unfamiliar with how to clone a repository, follow the [official GitHub guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository).
    - via HTTP: `git clone https://github.com/usdot-its-jpo-data-portal/sandbox_exporter.git`
    - via SSH (if using 2-factor authentication): `git clone git@github.com:usdot-its-jpo-data-portal/sandbox_exporter.git`
2. Navigate into the repository folder by entering `cd sandbox_exporter` in command line.
3. Run `pip install -e .` to install the sandbox_exporter Python package.
4. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Usage

#### Use as python package
`SandboxExporter` can be imported into your own code by adding the following statement:

`from sandbox_exporter.exporter import SandboxExporter`

Sample usage have been provided in the [demo.ipynb](demo.ipynb) file in this repository.

#### Use as command line script
The Sandbox Exporter can also be used in the command line directly.

Run `python sandbox_exporter/exporter.py --help` in commandline to get the script usage information below:
```
usage: exporter.py [-h] [--bucket BUCKET] [--pilot PILOT]
                   [--message_type MESSAGE_TYPE] --sdate SDATE [--edate EDATE]

  --output_convention OUTPUT_CONVENTION
                        Supply string for naming convention of output file.
                        Variables available for use in this string include:
                        pilot, messate_type, sdate, edate. Note that a file
                        number will always be appended to the output file

                        fields 'metadata' and 'payload.coreData' only, supply
                        's.metadata,s.payload.coreData'. Default: all fields
                        will be returned.

                        s.payload.data.coreData.speed < 15. Default: not
                        supply a WHERE clause.
```
Example Usage in command line:
- Retrieve all WYDOT BSM data from 2020-01-22:
`python -u sandbox_exporter/exporter.py --pilot wydot --message_type bsm -sdate 2020-01-22`

- Retrieve all WYDOT BSM data between 2020-01-22:
`python -u sandbox_exporter/exporter.py --pilot wydot --message_type bsm --sdate 2020-01-22`

- Retrieve all WYDOT BSM data between 2020-01-22 to 2020-01-24 in json newline format (instead of flattened CSV), only retrieving the metadata field:
`python -u sandbox_exporter/exporter.py --pilot wydot --message_type bsm --sdate 2020-01-22 --edate 2020-01-24 --json --output_fields 's.metadata' --verbose`
